## Ok change of direction...

So I'm having fun trying to grapple with how go sees relative paths in the code. 

What I was attempting to do was write and test the script locally using image files in the code folder.

I'm clearly not totally grasping how go sees file paths right now. So I'll put that on the back burner for now (seems important to grasp eventually!) and pivot.

Now what I'll do is use the http library to fetch images using absolute paths and process them through my algo from there. 

Wish me luck! I'm going in!

Ok I also will start with parsing the paths from a given csv using golang's csv stdlib package.

## EOD

So, progress made!

I can open and parse a csv file! Get the images and pop them into a slice of arrays so I can loop through them and compare each pair one by one.

I'm now at the point where I have images (of type image.Image) and can pass them to my comparison algorithm.

But...I need to do a type coersion from image.Image to image.RGBA. So far no luck. Will revisit tomorrow!

Once I sovle that it's on to formatting the data and writing it all back to a csv!
