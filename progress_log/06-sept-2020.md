## Ok change of direction...

So I'm having fun trying to grapple with how go sees relative paths in the code. 

What I was attempting to do was write and test the script locally using image files in the code folder.

I'm clearly not totally grasping how go sees file paths right now. So I'll put that on the back burner for now (seems important to grasp eventually!) and pivot.

Now what I'll do is use the http library to fetch images using absolute paths and process them through my algo from there. 

Wish me luck! I'm going in!
