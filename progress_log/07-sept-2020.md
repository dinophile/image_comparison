## Monday. I was never a huge fan of them

So where I am after figuring out how to get access to my images:

Yes, this took a good chunk of my day! What I love about golang is you really have to sit and think about the problem you're trying to solve and how because go does not let you hide behind any fancy libraries or methods! There is no `magicMethod()` to just get information from a file and I love this!

I can now run the script with `go run main.go` using a hard coded path for my `csv` file (for now).

I hit the error of `Image bounds not equal` which is fantastic!! Seriously! I couldn't be happier!

### A note about error handling
I have a lot of simple error handling `ifs` scattered throughout and I would like to learn if that's acceptable for go vs creating an error handling module to clean up the code? Sometimes I get a little hung up on trying to make the code 'cleaner' when go is more about readability vs cleverness! So that's something I'd like to look into. (Adding to my TODOs!)

### Next Steps

Next I need to find a way to resize each image and also make sure their resolutions are comparable. Then I should be able to get a value back! :yay: 

From there I can then test my elapsed time soltuion. Going to use the time API in go:

```golang
    start := time.Now()
    // stuff happens here
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
```
