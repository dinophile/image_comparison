## Mostly research today

I've decided to use golang to build my script and ultimately the service. Can be compiled and passed to different OSs without too much trouble. 

Even better a running API would be even easier to put out there. If building an internal application this could be a handy little microservice tailored to whatever business needs there are. 

Definitely not going to use a third party API. If this _is_ an application meant for internal business use then without enough time to vet policy/company etc no way would I want to upload potential IP to a service I can't vet.

I know that speed is always preferred by my PMs! But I'm paranoid enough to talk them down from this ledge! (Probably my public service experience talking! Time is not worth leaking IP!)

So today looked into how to compare an image in various ways. Narrowed down to a few algorithms and will decide tomorrow. 

Set up repo (Edit - forgot to push until the 4th! :D), captured requirements and set up rough TODO checklist to keep track of progress.
